# Stage 4: Compile-from-IR with Graph-Liveness Memory Planning

*Design, 2026-06-12. Companion to `architecture-debt.md` (stages table, row 4).
Written at the end of the cycle that landed stages 0–3; every claim about
existing machinery refers to code in-tree at commit ed779c6.*

## Why (tied to the ledger)

The compiled plan today is a **trace**: one normal execution runs with a
recorder attached, and replays re-issue the recorded GPU calls. Two
structural debts follow, and the bug ledger shows both being paid repeatedly:

1. **The recorder must see every effect.** Ten `record*` hooks exist
   (dispatch/alloc/copy/write/clear/volatile-uniform/barrier + the recorded
   copy helper + params-slot assignment + bind-group capture). Every hook
   that was missing at some point was a silent-training-corruption bug found
   by loss archaeology: unrecorded `copyBufferToBuffer` (embedding grads
   +1×/replay), unrecorded `clearBuffer` (stale scatter-add accumulators),
   unrecorded uniform rewrites (frozen `step_size`, wrong LR schedule for
   weeks), params bytes baked at record time (now guarded, 8115349). A
   trace-based replay is only as correct as the discipline of the thing it
   traces — discipline does not scale.

2. **Memory is emergent, not planned.** Buffer assignment falls out of
   dispatch order (the per-position arena), so ownership ended up split
   across seven regimes (pool, arena, plan-pinned, params-sequence cache,
   tile-config caches, f16WeightCache, packed-optimizer cache), and the
   worst bug class of the cycle — UAF, double-release, destroyed-buffer
   submits, stale-grad replays — lived on the seams BETWEEN regimes. The
   liveness arena + planned buffers (3b45531) bounded the memory but kept
   the regimes; donation (33be5fb) reuses dying buffers but as a kernel-side
   special form.

Compile-from-IR inverts both: the command stream and the buffer assignment
are **derived from the lowered plan**. There is nothing to forget to record,
and every buffer has one owner: the planner.

## What already exists (reuse, don't rebuild)

- **Lowered plan** (`lowered-plan.ts`): typed actions (sequential, fused,
  matmul-epilogue, adam-batch, batched-reduction) over a fingerprint-cached
  template. This IS the IR to compile from.
- **Liveness analysis** (`executor.ts`): per-node last-reader in action-index
  space, cross-plan consumer protection (6d29f5c), WAR ordering + checkpoint
  barriers + affinity in one Kahn pass (98eea29, b791d72).
- **Scalars-as-data** (d822be9, 2809588, 7101ebb): scalar table, payload
  fingerprinting, thrash detector. Per-step values already flow as data.
- **Planned buffers** (aa2a7f5): proof that replaying a fixed buffer
  assignment under the bounded pool works (124M/Medium validated). Stage 4
  replaces "pin what the recording happened to allocate" with "assign what
  the planner computes".
- **Stream-level validation culture**: every optimized path has a
  differential gate that crosses its activation threshold. Stage 4's
  migration gate is a differential at the command-stream level.

## Target architecture

```
lowered plan (template-cached, fingerprinted)
   │
   ├─ DispatchPlanner: per-action → DispatchPlan
   │     {pipeline, workgroups, bindingRoles, tempRequests, uniformSpec}
   │     (declarative; no GPU calls)
   │
   ├─ MemoryPlanner: liveness intervals (+ temps) → BufferAssignment
   │     interval allocation over size classes; donation = assignment
   │     decision; persistent/external/in-place constraints honored
   │
   └─ StreamEmitter: (DispatchPlans, BufferAssignment) → GpuCommand[]
         the SAME GpuCommand stream format replays execute today
```

Recording is **demoted to cross-check**: in debug/CI mode, run the recorder
alongside and diff recorded vs generated streams (pipelines, binding slots,
workgroups, copy/clear/uniform commands). Divergence = bug in one of them,
found at the seam instead of in a loss curve.

## Phases (each independently shippable, each gated)

### Phase 0 — Stream differential harness + DispatchPlan interface
- Canonical serialization of a `GpuCommand[]` stream (pipeline identity by
  cache key, buffers by slot, bytes for uniforms/params).
- `diffStreams(a, b)` with attribution (which action produced the
  divergence).
- Determinism gate: record the same template twice, diff → must be empty
  (pins stream determinism, which everything below assumes).
- `DispatchPlan` type + registry stub; no behavior change.

### Phase 0+1 status (2026-06-12): SHIPPED
Phase 0 landed in ca7ff56 (determinism gate caught two real ownership bugs
at build: scalar-table buffers adopted as persistent slots; cache-owned tile
configs destroyed at plan teardown). Phase 1 landed opt-in in 067be59, then
phase 1.5 (below) made it the default and DELETED the pin mechanism.

### Phase 1.5 — Cross-plan packing (SHIPPED 2026-06-12)
Finding: the pin mechanism's cross-plan sharing was never "forward's dead
activations serve backward" — adoption at build time removes a plan's
recorded buffers from pool circulation BEFORE later plans record, so the
only sharing that ever existed was earlier plans' intra-plan-dead TEMPS
(investigated via an "external death claims" prototype that re-expressed
recorded reuse identity-independently: structurally zero witnesses).

Since plans within a step execute strictly sequentially, ANY non-result
planner buffer is safe to share with any other plan, in any order. Temps
draw from a step-scoped shared PlannerRegistry (module-global, reset at
engine-instance boundaries with a generation guard); results keep exclusive
entries. This shares deterministically and completely what the pool shared
opportunistically.

Gates (A100 same-machine A/B): peak memory planner BEATS pin ~14% on both
distil@512 (5.07 vs 5.88GB) and medium@512 (15.0 vs 17.5GB); steady-state
speed parity; fullstack parity to fp noise; determinism PASS; 124M
regression PASS both modes; suites green both modes. Deleted: adoption
refcounting, pool-origin tracking, allocBuffers, planned-bind replay
fallbacks, bufferPool.adoptBuffer. TORCHLETTE_MEMORY_PLANNER=0 now disables
compiled replay wholesale (lowered path) — a dynamic-alloc replay would
leak ownerless temp buffers, so it is not offered.

### Phase 1 — Memory planner against RECORDED streams
Keep recording for WHAT to dispatch; replace the buffer assignment:
- Inputs: per-slot byte sizes + first/last use (from the recorded alloc/
  bind history + liveness), persistent/external/pinned sets, in-place
  aliases (donation, scatter dst), chunking constraints
  (maxStorageBufferBindingSize), WebGPU binding-aliasing rules (one buffer
  must not be bound writable twice in a dispatch, nor read+write).
- Algorithm: greedy interval allocation (sort by start, first-fit into
  freed intervals per size class; offset packing within large slabs is a
  later optimization — size-class granularity matches the pool today).
- Output: slot → buffer table, owned by the plan; allocated once, freed on
  template eviction via the fence-gated path.
- Gates: peak-memory ≤ planned-buffers mode on distil/Medium/124M; full
  ladder (fullstack parity both modes, regression both modes, suites,
  1-peer A/B); donation subsumption check (the kernel-side donation can be
  disabled when the planner aliases output to dying input — verify equal
  memory).
- Expected wins: deterministic memory bounds; arena dependence gone from
  compiled mode; likely closes the foreach 9.3→~5GB gap → unblocks the
  optimizer-island endgame (architecture-debt stage 3).

### Phase 2 — Stream generation for declarative ops
- Tile-IR kernels (configs are already data; TAG_UNIFORM packers exist),
  fused elementwise recipes, creation ops (TAG_WRITE/TAG_CLEAR semantics
  already defined), strided-scatter DMAs, cat copies.
- Executor: if every action in a plan is plannable → emit generated stream
  (validated against recording by the phase-0 differential in CI); else
  record/replay as today. Coverage is a counter, not a cliff.

### Phase 2 status (2026-06-13): PROOF POINT REACHED
`src/executor/stream-generate.ts` generates the GpuCommand stream from the
lowered plan; the executor's `TORCHLETTE_STREAM_GENERATE=1` hook diffs it
against the recording. Diffing is **segment-aligned** (per-action, modulo a
consistent slot bijection — the stream is slot-renaming-invariant, so
raw-slot `diffStreams` is right only for record-vs-record determinism); a
fully-covered plan adds a flat command-count assertion. Generators landed:
data-source (tensorFromArray/zeros), binary/unary/cast/contiguous/gelu,
sum (full reduction), unscaleGrad (volatile TAG_UNIFORM), stridedScatterCopy
(in-place DMA), fused recipes (`planFusedKernel`, post-hoc donation
detection), adam-batch (`planAdamStepDispatch` + `lookupPackedBuffers` +
`planPackedGroups`, f16 variant), matmul-epilogue (`planTiledMatmul`
standard path, reads the action's `cachedDispatchConfig`).

**Proof point: the optimizer plan is FULLY GENERATED** — 439/439 actions,
437/437 segments verified, flat 1746/1746 commands, zero divergences. The
differential paid for itself en route: it caught a latent stale-`zeros`
replay hazard, a recording-attribution bug (fused/epilogue actions
inheriting the prior node's index), and a grid-normalization mismatch —
all at build time, never in a loss curve.

Forward 256/289, cross-entropy plan 89/91, backward 255/414.

**The phase-2/phase-3 boundary (the line, characterized):** everything
DECLARATIVE or carrying a lowering-time config (matmul-epilogue's
`cachedDispatchConfig`) generates. The remainder — bare `op:matmul` (67),
fused LayerNorm/attention/cross-entropy, gather, narrowBackward — bails with
`released-input`: their inputs are **liveness-released by plan-build time**,
so geometry that depends on live input strides (matmul transpose detection)
or op-internal workspaces cannot be reconstructed at generation. matmul-
epilogue worked *because* its geometry was captured at lowering (when inputs
were live) and cached. That is exactly phase 3's mandate, now concrete:
capture each imperative op's resolved plan at lowering and cache it where the
generator reads it. A bare-matmul generator was built, measured (100%
`released-input`), and reverted as dead code — `planTiledMatmul`/
`planBinaryDirect`/`planUnaryDirect`/`planCastDirect`/`planContiguousDirect`
plan-cores were kept (the dispatchers consume them; the splits are sound).

### Phase 3 — Planning interfaces for imperative ops
- matmul (tile config selection, K-split temps, epilogues), attention
  (workspaces, D-precompute), fused LN/CE (partials), adamStep/packed.
- Each gets `plan(shapes, dtypes, config) → DispatchPlan` next to its
  imperative dispatch; the imperative form remains as the lowered-path
  executor. This is where op-internal allocations become planner-visible
  temps (today they are the "persistent slot" pin class).
- adamStep's config payload becomes planner uniform data → the TAG_UNIFORM
  per-op registry dies; with foreach default (unblocked by phase 1), the
  mega-op itself can go.
- **Concrete entry point (from the phase-2 boundary):** the unifying need is
  capturing resolved geometry AT LOWERING TIME (inputs live) and caching it
  where the generator reads it post-hoc. matmul-epilogue already does this
  via `cachedDispatchConfig`; bare matmul has no per-action object (it's a
  `sequential` action) → cache on the lazy node (node-keyed plan cache) from
  the matmul op handler's first live execution. First increment: bare-matmul
  node plan-cache (covers 67 matmuls, reuses `planTiledMatmul`); then the
  same mechanism for the fused LN/attention/CE kernels (their plan() also
  declares the op-internal workspace temps).

### Phase 3 progress (2026-06-13)
Covered: all declarative tile ops; matmul (bare + epilogue + K-split, 100%
both directions); LayerNorm fwd + gradX + gradWeightBias (100%, incl. the
op-internal partial-sum WORKSPACE — cached workspace buffers bind as
persistent slots via read-only lookup, the K-split-temp/packed-buffer
mechanism); narrowBackward (grad shape captured at lowering via
`cachedInputShapes` — its grad is a released multi-output extra);
adam-batch; fusedAttention FORWARD. Three capture mechanisms cover the
"generator can't derive it post-hoc" cases: `cachedMatmulPlan` (geometry),
`cachedInputShapes` (released multi-output input shapes), and read-only
workspace/config lookups (`lookupKSplitTempBuffer`, `lookupPackedBuffers`,
`lookupAttentionConfigBuffer`). **Coverage: 100% — every plan in the
canonical trainer (forward, backward, optimizer) is FULLY GENERATED, 0
diverged, command counts equal.** A latent bug fell out:
`getOrCreateConfigBuffer` never populated its cache (re-created the
attention config uniform every dispatch) — fixed (perf + stable identity
for the generator).

**Cross-entropy fwd+bwd (DONE).** `ceFwd`/`ceBwd` are module-level cached
dispatchers (stable identity already), one dispatch each, geometry fully in
the payload config {batchSize, vocabSize, ignoreIndex} — no shape
derivation. Added planCrossEntropyForward/BackwardDispatch + generators.
Output is `allocateOutputBuffer` (arena kind 1, empty inputSlots — NOT the
kind-0 resolveOutputBuffer with aliasing inputs); the diff caught both at
build time. Guards: targets i32/u32 (else ensureI32Targets casts) and
logits/grad contiguous (else asContiguous copies), via
`resolveContiguousInputSlot`.

**Scalar-operand elementwise (DONE).** A binary/unary op with a `kind:
"scalar"` operand now binds the scalar's scalar-table buffer
(`lookupScalarStorage`) as a PERSISTENT slot — the executor refreshes its
value per step, so it's a persistent binding, not a stream write. General
across any scalar-operand elementwise op; the legacy CPU/non-f32
full([],v) fallback (table miss) still bails. Subtlety the diff caught: the
scalar-table buffer is persistent so resolveOutputBuffer excludes it from
the output's aliasing candidates — the ALLOC's inputSlots must list only
poolable operands (track `aliasInSlots` separately from the DISPATCH
bindings).

**Nothing uncovered — the expand/broadcast producers are now covered too.**
The previously-"correctly-excluded" `contiguous(expand)×2` (fwd) and
`mul(a, expand(b))×1` (bwd) were excluded because a released strided view's
stride-bearing layout (broadcast stride-0) "isn't shape-derivable." That is
exactly what capture-don't-synthesize solves: `cachedStridedInputs` captures
each strided-view input's live layout at lowering (expand/transpose/permute/
narrow producers of a sequential elementwise op), and generateSequential
synthesizes the real strided metadata so planBinaryDirect/planUnaryDirect
emit the matching broadcast/gather kernel (the cache key includes strides, so
pipeline identity matches the recording). Generalizes the per-op capture from
attention/reshape into one mechanism for any released strided-view input.
**The recorder is now ready to become a pure cross-check (phase 4).**

**fusedAttentionBackward (DONE — and the "bijection blocker" was stale).**
The 2026-06-13 doc claimed a lifetime-split-slot bijection blocker: dV read
by narrowBackward across a recordAlloc slot split, rejected by the differ's
1:1 gen↔rec map. An instrumented trace (TORCHLETTE_PROBE_SPLIT) DISPROVED
it: every attention-bwd output buffer is allocated once, bound at exactly
one slot, consumed by one downstream view at that same slot — **no split**.
Phase-1.5's planner-derived buffer assignment (one owner per buffer, derived
from liveness — the XLA model) had already dissolved the physical-reuse
artifact the blocker described. The ACTUAL blockers were two general
contiguous-copy gaps, both now fixed:
- **Attention contiguous-prologue.** The op asContiguous's its inputs; a
  non-contiguous one (e.g. dO) records one resolveOutputBuffer ALLOC + one
  planContiguousDirect copy dispatch the generator didn't emit. Fix: capture
  each input's layout at lowering (`cachedInputContig`, replacing the old
  `cachedAllInputsContig` boolean); `generateAttention` replays
  planContigCopy for the non-contiguous ones (mirrors ensureContiguous —
  copy iff isContiguous===false — so the command count matches) and rebinds
  the kernel input to the copy slot.
- **reshape materialization.** A `reshape` (uniquely among the view ops)
  materializes a contiguous copy when its input is non-contiguous AND the
  new shape is stride-incompatible (`inferReshapeStrides===null`) — e.g.
  reshape-of-permute in attention's grad reshaping (dV→permute→reshape→
  narrowBackward). The generator treated reshape as an always-free view.
  Fix: capture `cachedViewInput` for reshape view actions, OBSERVING the
  copy decision (result.buffer !== input.buffer) rather than re-deriving it
  — a non-contiguous input with compatible strides is still a free view, so
  the isContiguous predicate over-triggers (it did, and the diff caught the
  spurious copies as 24 unmatched segments in a non-attention plan). The
  view case emits planContigCopy when the input materialized, else aliases.
Both share `planContigCopy`. bwd 405→413/414; 0 diverged across all plans.

**Needed-intermediate re-execution (DONE — was "the hardest/last class,"
turned out mechanical).** A fused group's internal elementwise nodes that
are consumed OUTSIDE the group but couldn't be promoted to additional fused
outputs (shape ≠ primary, or out of binding slots) are re-executed
sequentially after the fused dispatch (`executeFusedSegment` →
`executeSequentialSegment`). That re-execution never resets the recording
node index (`executeNode` doesn't touch it), so its commands land in the
SAME segment as the fused dispatch. `generateFused` now mirrors it: after
the kernel dispatch, it generates each needed-intermediate's plain
ALLOC+DISPATCH via `generateSequential` (the same elementwise path
`executeNode` takes), resolving inputs against a LOCAL node.id→slot map
seeded with this group's own primary + promoted-additional output slots
(assigned inside `generateFused`, not yet in the outer `nodeSlot`) plus
earlier intermediates, falling back to the outer channel for true external
inputs. Kept atomic: a needed-intermediate that itself can't be generated
bails the whole action. bwd 397→405/414; 0 diverged.

Added since: **gather** (forward, single-sourced on `planGatherDirect`);
**scatterAdd** (embedding backward ×2, single-sourced on
`planScatterAddDirect`; its src grad is a released contiguous `reshape`
view — covered by `contiguousViewShapeDtype`, which derives logical
shape/dtype for the reshape/view/flatten/squeeze/unsqueeze class since
their layout is contiguous-offset-0); **released contiguous-view inputs to
elementwise ops** (the synthesized-metadata fallback now also covers the
contiguous-view class, clearing `cast[no-storage]` fwd+bwd). Strided views
(expand/broadcast) stay bailed — layout not shape-derivable, contiguous
metadata would mislead the kernel; the remaining `contiguous[no-storage]×2`
/ `mul[no-storage]×1` are all `expand` producers, correctly excluded.

**`mean` (DONE — the first-pass "captured-state" diagnosis was wrong).**
`backend.mean()` (the path a plain `.mean()` node takes) does NOT use the
invCount epilogue: it dispatches `sum` (cached full/dim reduction) into an
intermediate buffer, then a `meanDiv` dispatch through the cached `"meanDiv"`
dispatcher with `count` in a UNIFORM (not a buffer). So a mean node is ONE
node → two ALLOC+dispatch pairs, both fully generatable. `generateMean` +
`planMeanDivDispatch` cover it; the sum part reuses
`planFullReductionDispatch`/`planDimReductionDispatch`. The fresh per-call
`invCount` buffer only exists in `meanWithEpilogue` (the path taken when a
user epilogue chain is fused onto the mean) — a different op the trainer's
loss `.mean()` doesn't reach; if it ever shows up it stays the captured-state
case (a cached dispatcher + count-keyed invCount-buffer cache would close it).

**Dim reductions (DONE) — the cached-dispatcher cleanup the `mean` note
predicted, applied to the dim path.** Dim reductions previously dispatched
through a FRESH `createTileKernelDispatcher` per call (no config-buffer
caching, no stable identity — same disease as `mean`). Fixed: route them
through a CACHED dispatcher (`getDimReductionDispatcher`, keyed by
op+inputShape+dims+keepdim+epilogue-signature; the input is forced
contiguous at the dispatch site so strides/outShape/useParallel are all
derived) — `buildDimReductionSpec` is the single source for the dispatch
path and the new `planDimReductionDispatch`. This removes a per-call config
allocation AND gives the generator a stable identity. Covered:
`sum[dim-reduction]` singleton (`generateDimReduction`) and the
`batched-reduction` ACTION (`generateBatchedReduction`). The latter was the
surprise: its members all have reductionSize 2048 (>64), so
`backend.batchedReduction` falls back to N individual `reduction()`
dispatches (the true multi-in/out batched kernel only fires for small
reductionSize), all recorded under `nodeIndices[0]` — so the generator just
loops the per-member dim-reduction emit into one segment, and bails the
whole action if the executor would instead take the true-batched path
(≤64). mean-over-dim stays excluded (its invCount epilogue buffer is fresh
per call — the same captured-state gap as full mean). bwd 392→395/414.

**RESOLVED (was "KNOWN BLOCKER — fusedAttentionBackward / lifetime-split-slot
limit").** The 2026-06-13 claim — narrowBackward reads dV across a recordAlloc
lifetime split, rejected by the 1:1 gen↔rec bijection — was investigated with
an instrumented trace (TORCHLETTE_PROBE_SPLIT) and DISPROVED: attention-bwd
outputs are each allocated once and bound at exactly one slot (no split). The
phase-1.5 planner (one owner per buffer, derived from liveness) had already
removed the physical-reuse artifact. The real blockers were two general
contiguous-copy gaps (attention asContiguous prologue + reshape-of-strided
materialization), both fixed — see the phase-3 progress section above.
Lesson: a "structural limit" pinned to an old architecture's behavior must be
re-confirmed against current code before being treated as a design fork; the
cheap instrumented trace overturned a multi-session redesign plan in minutes.

### Phase 4 — Deletions and dividends

**Pre-cutover deletion audit (2026-06-13): there is NO safe deletion before
the cutover.** Every item below was confirmed load-bearing in the CURRENT
path, so the "deletions" are CONSEQUENCES of the cutover (the generator+planner
becoming the sole build source), not independent dead code to clear first:
- `pinnedBufferSet` — NOT the deleted pin mechanism (that's gone clean: 0 refs
  to adoptBuffer/poolOrigin/allocBuffers/plannedBind). It is the CURRENT memory
  planner's buffer-ownership mechanism (registry entries pinned to survive plan
  teardown; consulted by every destroy/release/harvest path). Load-bearing.
- params-sequence cache (`createParamsBuffer`/`paramsSequenceSet`) — allocates
  every dispatch's params/uniform buffer; core to both the lowered first
  execution and replay. Becomes planner slots only AFTER the cutover.
- per-position arena (`allocateOutputBuffer`/`arenaAllocAt`) — the canonical
  output allocation for every backend op, active in BOTH liveness (default) and
  legacy modes. The pool-hint machinery (`outputSequenceHints`/
  `pinnedOutputBuffers`/`conflictDetected`) is used by `resolveOutputBuffer` +
  the shared encoder during the first (lowered) execution. Not dead.
- legacy unbudgeted arena (`TORCHLETTE_ARENA_LIVENESS=0`) — a SUPPORTED opt-out
  / planner-bug fallback, not vestigial. Dropping it is a product decision.

**So the order is cutover-first.** The cutover: make `buildCompiledPlan`
consume the GENERATED stream (proven byte-identical modulo slot bijection)
instead of the recorded log — wiring nodeResults / slot sources / planner
assignment from the generated segments — behind a flag, validated by the full
parity ladder both directions. THEN the record* hooks demote to a gate-only
cross-check and the above become deletable as the planner subsumes them.
- Dividends: serializable compiled plans (a generated plan has no live GPU
  pointers → ~700ms cold start dies); single answer to "who owns this
  buffer"; the architecture-debt rules become enforced by construction.

## Risks and mitigations
- **Imperative-op long tail** (phase 3): mitigated by per-op fallback — no
  cutover moment; coverage counters make progress visible.
- **Stream nondeterminism** (would break the differential): pinned by the
  phase-0 record-twice gate before anything else lands.
- **Planner bugs = the old seam bugs in new clothes**: the differential
  ladder (fullstack/regression/suites) plus the loud-GPU-error surface and
  idempotent pool remain as backstops; planner output is also validated
  structurally (no interval overlap, no aliasing-rule violation) at build
  time — cheap asserts, always on.
- **Browser**: same GpuCommand stream format; ENV accessor (eafd4e2) keeps
  flags safe; browser suite is part of every phase gate.

## Invariants that carry over unchanged
Fence-gated destruction (6e73011/3401445 + CLAUDE.md rule); scalars enter
kernels as data or fingerprint-guarded payloads (d822be9/2809588); WAR +
barrier + affinity scheduling (98eea29/b791d72); instance boundaries are
cache boundaries (4d94ff4); every new optimized path lands with a
cross-threshold differential.
